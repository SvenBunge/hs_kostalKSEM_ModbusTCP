# Kostal KSEM ModbusTCP (14180)
Gira Homeserver 4 Logikmodule to poll power values from Kostal Smart Energy Meter (KSEM) via Modbus TCP.

## Developer Notes

Developed for the GIRA HomeServer 4.10 / 4.11!
Licensed under the LGPL to keep all copies & forks free!

:exclamation: **If you fork this project and distribute the module by your own CHANGE the Logikbaustein-ID because 14181 is only for this one and registered to @SvenBunge !!** :exclamation:

If something doesn't work like expected: Just open an issue. Even better: Fix the issue and fill a pull request.

## Installation

Download a [release](https://github.com/SvenBunge/hs_modbus_tcp/releases) and install the module / Logikbaustein like others in Experte.
You find the module in the category "Energiemanagement". Just pic the IP address, port and unit-id of your inverter and wire the output to your communication objects. 

The latest version of the module is also available in the [KNX-User Forum Download Section](https://service.knx-user-forum.de/?comm=download&id=14180)

## Documentation

This module fetches power information and states from home solar power inverters of the manufacturer "Kostal". It has been tested with the *Kostal Plenticore Plus 10* with 2 strings and an BYD battery attached.

### Keep notice

* No output is SBC (send-by-change) - all are fired every interval
* Yield value fields: If the battery is loaded DC/DC, the amount of energy is not included in those values and unloading the battery will increase the yield. Work around: Add the SOC / 100 * battery capacity to get it approximated. (Output number 12-14)
  * Or update your inverter firmware, set input number 6 = 1 and use the new outputs: 26-34
* Only voltage(U) and current(I) is fetched from the DC-Strings. If the power(P) in Watts is needed, just calculate them ( P = U * I ). At DC-Level this should be correct. 

## Build from scratch

1. Download [Schnittstelleninformation](http://www.hs-help.net/hshelp/gira/other_documentation/Schnittstelleninformationen.zip) from GIRA Homepage
2. Decompress zip, use `HSL SDK/2-0/framework` Folder for development.
3. Checkout this repo to the `projects/hs_kostalInverterModbusTCP` folder
4. Run the generator.pyc (`python2 ./generator.pyc hs_kostalInverterModbusTCP`)
5. Import the module `release/14181_kostalInverterModbusTCP.hsl` into the Experte Software
6. Use the module in your logic editor

You can replace step 4 with the `./buildRelease.sh` script. With the help of the markdown2 python module (`pip install markdown2`) it creates the documentation and packages the `.hslz` file. This file is also installable in step 5 and adds the module documentation into the Experte-Tool.  
 
## Libraries
